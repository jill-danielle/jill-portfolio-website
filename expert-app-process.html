            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              People in the Philippines have trouble finding real experts online who can help them whenever they are faced in unfamiliar situations where they can call or message someone easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our challenge is to provide people an app where they can search for verified experts from different fields of expertise and communicate with them anytime.
            </p>
            <p>
              “People have trouble finding real experts online”

            <p>
              Yellow Pages PH and Quora are the main platforms which users usually use for looking up experts or services online because Yellow Pages PH has a great database of services offered but it is not updated regularly while Quora has a great
              Q&A platform but most contributors are not really experts on the topic they usually answer which leaves users more frustrated.
            </p>

              “Most contributors are not really experts which leaves users more frustrated”
            </p>
            <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
            <p>
              Expert App aims to provide people from different ages and different backgrounds a quick way to video-call or messages experts they choose anytime and anywhere!
            </p>
            <p>
              How?
            </p>
            <p>
              Expert App will have verified Experts and will have the necessary information listed in their bio including their availability times so that users can easily pick the experts they prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
              This app will also require partial payment for the advance video-call bookings of the expert so that Experts will be protected from uncertain bookings and last-minute cancellations.

                <li>To understand the attitudes, behaviors, motivations, and needs of a user who is looking for help.​</li>
                <li>To determine what process the users take in choosing an expert.</li>
                <li>To discover where the users usually get the information or opinion they need.</li>
                <li>To discover if users are using apps or website that has a similarity to Expert App.</li>

            <h2>Affinity Mapping and Insights</h2>
            <p>
              To understand the users' behaviors and needs, I conducted a series of user interviews and usability testing to gather data from the user’s and fixed those into an affinity map.
            </p>
            <p>
              Affinity mapping is one of the best ways to gather data and to organize data gathered from different users. This also helped me focus my priority on the most important things to do because I can organize the opinions of users according
              to their needs and behaviors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Affinity Mapping gave me a lot of interesting insights from 5 participants I have interviewed by determining what their behavior, attitudes, needs, goals, and frustrations when they search for help.
            </p>
            <h3>The Following Insights Are:</h3>
            <div>
              <h3>Importance of HOW to find solutions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>When people need help, they want to get straight to the point instead of getting the runaround.</li>
                <li>Most people who weren’t able to find solutions on the web just did the trial and error method until their problem is fixed or manageable.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Importance of WHERE to find solutions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Half of the Users go to YouTube for instructional videos.</li>
                <li>Most of the Users go straight to Google.</li>
                <li>Some users go to Facebook groups and forums to get an opinion.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Importance of RELIABILITY and CREDIBILITY of the SOURCE</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Users need to cross-analyze data they’ve obtained from different sources like Facebook Groups, Forums, Known Communities, Wikipedia and YouTube before taking an action.</li>
                <li>Sometimes when Users cross-analyzes data from different sources this can further confuse the user more when the different sources are conflicting on the same topic.</li>
                <li>Having a background information helps users to know if the person or website giving out opinions/solutions is credible or not.</li>
                <li>Half of the users want the references or background information for an expert like for example a doctor should state his credentials for the user to believe he is a legit practicing doctor.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              After extracting, interpreting and getting key insights from the data. It is now time to create user personas to help me develop Expert app by knowing who the target user is and to empathize with their needs.
            </p>
            <h2>User Persona</h2>
            <p>
              User personas are created by using the insights gathered from the affinity mapping. Personas are helpful in guiding me with the design in the early stages of the process because they provide me with an understanding of users in terms
              of goals and capabilities.

            <h2>User Journey</h2>
            <p>
              User Journey helps me visualize what my users' goals are, their motivations for using the app, their pain points while using the app, their personality and behavior, and the main tasks they want to achieve.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having a User Persona and User Journey in the early stages of the app is crucial in building an app that is user-centric. User personas and journeys can evolve along the design process as we learn more about the users and their
              behaviors.

              In organizing the app’s content hierarchy, I gathered participants to engage in a closed-card sorting activity to check if the hierarchy inside the app would make sense to them. After the card sorting activity, I assessed the data and
              revised some of the content so that users can easily navigate the app.

        <p>
          After doing the sitemap and analyzing everything, it’s time to sketch out the wireframes, I started sketching the main features by and creating a lo-fidelity prototype to test it with the users. After the lo-fidelity, mid-fidelity
          wireframes are created as more screens are added until creating high fidelity wireframes.
        </p>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframes are created to have Minimum Viable Product to test with users. These wireframes are supposed to provide basic functionality, contents, and information hierarchy. By having these, Wireframing helps me determine which features are
          wanted and which elements are needed.
        </p>
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
          After creating mid - fidelity wireframes, I did another round of user testing to check if users can perform specific tasks. The goal of this study is to assess the learnability, efficiency, errors, and satisfaction of the users in using
          Expert App. This study also aims to uncover more insights from users.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3>Test Script</h3>
          <p>
            I started the test with direct tasks for the users and after doing the tasks, I asked them open-ended questions that would help me understand them better and uncover more awareness on the things which I may have overlooked.
          </p>
          <h3>Direct Tasks</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Use Expert App to message and ask an Expert on how to best take care of your plants.​</li>
            <li>Use Expert App to post your question to gain different opinions from different people.​</li>
            <li>Use Expert App to video-call an Expert and show him your plant because it will be easier for you to describe and the Expert to explain what is happening to your plant.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Open-ended Questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>What is your first impression of the home screen? What do you think of the buttons?</li>
            <li>Please explore the app. Is there anything that you liked/disliked about this app?</li>
            <li>Would you suggest something to improve your experience with this app?</li>
            <li>What features do you think is essential for this app?</li>
            <li>Would you actually use this app?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          After the user-testing, I have gathered a lot of data to sort out and analyze into which categories they will go to in the rainbow spreadsheet.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          I used the Rainbow Spreadsheet to arrange the five categories that I got from the analysis mapping earlier and noted the issues where users got a lot of frequent errors. This helped me pinpoint the issues that need to be iterated first.
          The Rainbow Spreadsheet also helped me uncover the positive feedback I got from users and I can use this to data to promote more positive interactions from the app and the users. ​

          there is a standard to be followed.
